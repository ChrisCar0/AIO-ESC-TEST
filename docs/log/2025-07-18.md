## Objective
Continue working on block diagram for ESC Test Board

## Notes
**PI-Filter Design Notes (2nd-Order Butterworth)**

Parameters
- Cutoff frequency: 5 kHz
- System impedance: 0.01 Ω (chosen for low voltage drop with reasonable L/C sizing)
- Filter Type: 2nd-order Butterworth low pass PI-filter (flat passband, ~40 dB/dec rolloff)

Component values calculated using normalized prototype coefficients g<sub>1</sub> = g<sub>2</sub> = 1.4142:
$$L = \frac{g_1 \cdot Z_0}{\omega_c} $$
$$C = \frac{g_2}{Z_0 \cdot \omega_c} $$
$$ \omega_c = 2\pi \cdot f_c $$

## Work done
Calculated and designed a 2nd order Butterworth PI filter for the input of the board. Created a python script to try and help me narrow down component values for the filter.

## Decisions
Holding off on PI-filter at the moment. Hard to spec L/C components due to the high current rating of the board.  Will come back to it at a later date.

## Next actions
- [ ] Finish block diagram in draw.io for ESC Test Board.
- [ ] Gather footprints and symbols.
- [ ] Start schematic layout.
- [ ] Continue researching for AIO board.
